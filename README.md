EGG SIZE CLASSIFICATION DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS

It is clear that the egg is very important in human food basket. Offspring size is a fundamental trait 
in disparate biological fields of study. Egg size may be the third most important factor in determining 
profits from the laying flock. Small and medium eggs do not return cost of production and marketing to 
the producer. 
The size classification system provides useful information not only for consumers and egg producers but also for profiling breed characteristics in conservation and genetic improvement studies. It also improves the methods of selection of eggs. 
The current model focusses on determining whether the egg is normal egg (medium) or Ostrich egg (large) based on the size of the images of various eggs.
Tensorflow and Keras frameworks have been used as keras is better for small datasets. Nineteen types of 
eggs are taken as reference with each 5 records of various observations. Species, Length and width of the 
egg are the main parameters considered for the study.
